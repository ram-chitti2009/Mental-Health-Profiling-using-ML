The aim of the tutorial is to show opensim's ability to solve an inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics problem using experimental data.



This is sorta like reverse engineering-

so you are given the experimental data of actual gait- and inverse kin allows you to compute the joint angles, and inverse dynamics allows you to compute net joint reactions, and net joint movements that produce that experimental gait.



**Key Terms :**

Inverse kinematics computes the joint angles for a musculoskeletal model that best reproduce the motion of a subject.



Inverse Dynamics then use joint angles; angular velocities and angular accelerations of the mode, together with experimental groud reaction forces and movements to solve for the net reaction forces and moments at each of the joints.
