================================================================================
Step 3: Comparing profile characteristics across datasets
================================================================================
METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH:
  PRIMARY: Symptom pattern comparison (natural K)
    - Preserves each dataset's optimal K (natural structure)
    - Compares actual symptom patterns (Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Burnout)
    - Uses Hungarian algorithm to match best subset when K differs
    - Reports profile coverage: how many profiles matched / total profiles
    - Low coverage (<100%) indicates additional context-specific structure
    - Tests: 'Are symptom patterns similar across datasets?'

NOTE: Different optimal K values + incomplete profile coverage are
      interpreted as evidence for H2 (context-specificity), integrated
      into interpretation alongside symptom pattern correlations.

Comparing D2-Cultural profiles to D1-Swiss

  PRIMARY: Symptom Pattern Comparison (Natural K)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Testing: 'Are symptom patterns similar across datasets?'
    Note: Comparing 2 of 6 profiles
    → Preserving natural structure (not forcing K matching)
    → Extra profiles in larger dataset indicate additional structure
    D1-Swiss symptom matrix: (2, 4) (K=2 × 4 features)
    D2-Cultural symptom matrix: (6, 4) (K=6 × 4 features)

    Feature-wise correlations (n=2 profiles):
      Depression: r=1.0000 (p=1.000000)
      Anxiety: r=-1.0000 (p=1.000000)
      Stress: r=nan (p=nan)
      Burnout: r=1.0000 (p=1.000000)
    Average feature correlation: nan
    Overall symptom pattern correlation: -0.6327 (p=0.092278, n=8)

    Profile Coverage (PRIMARY METHOD):
      Matched profiles: 2 / 6 total
      Overall coverage: 33.3%
      D1-Swiss coverage: 100.0% (2/2 profiles)
      D2-Cultural coverage: 33.3% (2/6 profiles)
      → Unmatched profiles indicate additional context-specific structure

    Symptom Pattern Correlation (PRIMARY TEST):
      Correlation: r=-0.6327
      H1 threshold (r > 0.7): Not Met
      H2 threshold (r < 0.5): Met

    INTERPRETATION:
      Preliminary: Different K (2 vs 6) → Suggests context-specificity
      Coverage: 33.3% of profiles matched (2/6)
      → Unmatched profiles (4 profiles) indicate additional context-specific structure
      PRIMARY: Low symptom correlation (r=-0.6327) → CONFIRMS H2
      → CONCLUSION: CONTEXT-SPECIFIC (both K and patterns differ)

    INTERPRETATION:
      Preliminary: Same K (2) → Neutral
      Coverage: 100.0% of profiles matched (2/2) - Full coverage
      PRIMARY: Low symptom correlation (r=0.1584) → SUPPORTS H2

    Overall symptom pattern correlation: 0.1080 (p=0.799079, n=8)

    Profile Coverage (PRIMARY METHOD):
      Matched profiles: 2 / 3 total
      Overall coverage: 66.7%
      D1-Swiss coverage: 100.0% (2/2 profiles)
      D4-Tech coverage: 66.7% (2/3 profiles)
      → Unmatched profiles indicate additional context-specific structure

    Symptom Pattern Correlation (PRIMARY TEST):
      Correlation: r=0.1080
      H1 threshold (r > 0.7): Not Met
      H2 threshold (r < 0.5): Met

    INTERPRETATION:
      Preliminary: Different K (2 vs 3) → Suggests context-specificity
      Coverage: 66.7% of profiles matched (2/3)
      → Unmatched profiles (1 profiles) indicate additional context-specific structure
      PRIMARY: Low symptom correlation (r=0.1080) → CONFIRMS H2
      → CONCLUSION: CONTEXT-SPECIFIC (both K and patterns differ)

REPLICATION TESTING SUMMARY
================================================================================

METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH:
  PRIMARY: Symptom pattern comparison (natural K)
    - Preserves each dataset's optimal K (natural structure)
    - Compares actual symptom patterns (Depression, Anxiety, Stress, Burnout)
    - Uses Hungarian algorithm to match best subset when K differs
    - Reports profile coverage: how many profiles matched / total profiles
    - Tests: 'Are symptom patterns similar across datasets?'

INTERPRETATION NOTES:
  - Different optimal K values + incomplete profile coverage are evidence for H2
    (context-specificity), integrated into interpretation
  - Correlation computed on profiles (n=K, typically 2-6)
  - P-values should be interpreted with caution due to small sample size
  - Correlation coefficient (r) is the primary metric for hypothesis testing

OVERALL CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Reference: D1-Swiss (4D, K=2)
Datasets tested: 3

PRELIMINARY (Optimal K Comparison):
  Different K (H2 evidence): 2/3 datasets
  Same K (Neutral): 1/3 datasets

PRIMARY (Symptom Pattern Comparison - Natural K):
  H1 (Universal) supported: 0/3
  H2 (Context-Specific) supported: 3/3

================================================================================
✓ H2 VALIDATED: Profiles are CONTEXT-SPECIFIC
================================================================================
  PRELIMINARY: 2/3 datasets have different optimal K
    → Strong evidence that profiles are context-specific
    → Different populations have different profile structures
  PRIMARY: 3/3 datasets show low symptom pattern correlation
    → Confirms context-specificity (both structure and patterns differ)
  → Conclusion: Mental health profiles vary by population/culture/context
